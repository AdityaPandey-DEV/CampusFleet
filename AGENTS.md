## Best practices for developing on Vercel

These defaults are optimized for AI coding agents (and humans) working on apps that deploy to Vercel.

- Treat Vercel Functions as stateless + ephemeral (no durable RAM/FS, no background daemons), use Blob or marketplace integrations for preserving state
- Edge Functions (standalone) are deprecated; prefer Vercel Functions
- Don't start new projects on Vercel KV/Postgres (both discontinued); use Marketplace Redis/Postgres instead
- Store secrets in Vercel Env Variables; not in git or `NEXT_PUBLIC_*`
- Provision Marketplace native integrations with `vercel integration add` (CI/agent-friendly)
- Sync env + project settings with `vercel env pull` / `vercel pull` when you need local/offline parity
- Use `waitUntil` for post-response work; avoid the deprecated Function `context` parameter
- Set Function regions near your primary data source; avoid cross-region DB/service roundtrips
- Tune Fluid Compute knobs (e.g., `maxDuration`, memory/CPU) for long I/O-heavy calls (LLMs, APIs)
- Use Runtime Cache for fast **regional** caching + tag invalidation (don't treat it as global KV)
- Use Cron Jobs for schedules; cron runs in UTC and triggers your production URL via HTTP GET
- Use Vercel Blob for uploads/media; Use Edge Config for small, globally-read config
- If Enable Deployment Protection is enabled, use a bypass secret to directly access them
- Add OpenTelemetry via `@vercel/otel` on Node; don't expect OTEL support on the Edge runtime
- Enable Web Analytics + Speed Insights early
- Use AI Gateway for model routing, set AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY, using a model string (e.g. 'anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.6'), Gateway is already default in AI SDK
  needed. Always curl https://ai-gateway.vercel.sh/v1/models first; never trust model IDs from memory
- For durable agent loops or untrusted code: use Workflow (pause/resume/state) + Sandbox; use Vercel MCP for secure infra access

<!-- TRANSIT DOMAIN DATA ARCHITECTURE START -->
## Transit Domain Rules: Bus, Shift, Route, and Trip Hierarchy

1. **Hierarchy & Entity Definitions**:
   - **`Bus`**: Physical vehicle asset (`id`, `bus_number`, `registration_no`, `capacity`, `gps_device_id`).
   - **`Shift`**: Temporal transit schedule window (`id`, `name`, `type`, `start_time`, `end_time`, `direction`).
   - **`Route`**: Geographic line/corridor comprising an ordered sequence of physical stops (`route_stops`).
   - **`Trip`**: **Internal operational dispatch instance** combining (`Bus` + `Route` + `Shift` + `Date`).

2. **Public vs. Internal Isolation (Strict Non-Negotiable Rule)**:
   - **`Trip` (`trip_id`, `trip_code`) is strictly for INTERNAL usage**:
     - Used by telematics ingestion, backend dispatch engines, driver console GPS broadcasts, conductor manifests, and audit logging to identify a run at a particular time.
     - **NEVER expose or show raw `trip_id` or `trip_code` to the public or students** in the student portal, commuter pass, ticket UI, or notifications.
   - **Public / Student Facing Presentation**:
     - Commuters must only see human-friendly labels: **Bus Number** (e.g. "Bus 37"), **Shift Name** (e.g. "Morning Pick-Up"), **Route Name** (e.g. "Ganna Center Corridor"), and **Stop Departure Time** (e.g. "07:45 AM").
